## Running the Project Locally

These instructions will help you set up a copy of the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. This project requires Node.js version 18.15.0 or higher.

### Installing & Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishnanand2517/project-ignite
   ```

1. Navigate to the backend directory & install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

1. Copy the environment variables to a new file `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

   Obtain the values and API keys for the variables from their respective sources.

1. Once you have installed the project and its dependencies, you can run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the backend server on port 3001, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3001/.

1. Navigate to the frontend directory and install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

1. Run the development server for frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the frontend server on port 5173, and you can access the web app in your web browser at http://localhost:5173/
